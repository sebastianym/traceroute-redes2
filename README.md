# Proyecto: Trazado de Rutas (Traceroute)

This project is part of the Communications Networks 2 course at the Francisco Jose de Caldas District University. The application allows you to view and analyze network route traces, both locally and remotely, using traceroute commands from public and local servers. The main objective is to obtain detailed information about network routes, such as the number of hops, response time, and IP addresses, allowing users to analyze network behavior through various connection points around the world.

An interactive web application is implemented where users can select servers on different continents and view the traceroute results of high-traffic sites on the Internet. The results can be exported in TXT format to facilitate analysis and visualization.
